# Housing Prices and Air Quality (DSA210 Project Proposal)

## 1. Project Title
Relationship Between Housing Market Indicators and Air Quality

## 2. Motivation
The goal of this project is to see if there is any relationship between air quality and housing prices around the world.

## 3. Datasets
- **Dataset 1:** Global Housing Market Analysis 2015â€“2024 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-housing-market-analysis-2015-2024)
- **Dataset 2:** World Air Quality Data 2024 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/world-air-quality-data-2024-updated)

## 4. Data Collection
Both datasets will be downloaded as CSV files from Kaggle.  
They will be merged using the **Country** column at **2024**.

## 5. Planned Analysis
- Basic data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Compare average air quality with housing indicators (price, income, population growth)
- Simple visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts)
- Correlation analysis

## 6. Expected Outcome
To find if countries with cleaner air tend to have higher housing prices or better living conditions.
